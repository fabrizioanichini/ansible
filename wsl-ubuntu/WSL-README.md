# Introduction

This section is made to recreate the environment inside WSL2 of windows 11. You can find all the informations [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

## What it does

Install all the necessary packages and items to start working inside WSL. Because of the nature of WSL every other GUI applications must be installed with another 
package manage like [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)

## Notes

The fonts in WSL are managed directly from [windows terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal), so you need to install them directly on windows and select them from 
windows terminal settings.
